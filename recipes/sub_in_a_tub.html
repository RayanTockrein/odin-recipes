    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Most online versions of the salad begin with a big bowl of chopped romaine lettuce, t<br>
      opped with various deli meats and cheeses, tomatoes, onion, oregano, and salt, before it’s<br> 
      dressed with red wine vinegar and olive oil.<br>
      Then it’s time for customization! Use this as a base and add whatever other vegetables or<br>
      protein you like.</p>
    <p>
      <h2>Jersey Mike’s Copycat “Sub in a Tub”: </h2>
      Inspired, I set out to create my version, embracing the classic sub sandwich flavors,<br> 
      but with a few twists to make it more me. I kept the foundation of lettuce, tomato, onion, deli meats,<br>
       and cheeses. I also kept the seasoning and simple olive oil and red wine vinegar dressing.<br> 
       I tossed in some sliced banana peppers for a little bit of heat and acidity.<br> 
       I’m also a big crouton fan, so I made my own from French bread (store-bought works, too).<br> 
       Finally, I added some green bell pepper, because it just felt right, and olives because I love the <br>
       pop of briny saltiness.
